This is a blog / social media chat app similar to PERN-chat but not crap because it uses TailwindCSS and Prisma which handles all the backend SQL stuff for me and cuts down on the amount of code needed to write, also using Next-auth. I was going to add GraphQL but I changed my mind because it adds extra complexity for no reason.

You can also comment on comments, but you cannot comment on a comment on a comment, because I couldn't figure out how to do the schema for it, I might try to add it in again.
