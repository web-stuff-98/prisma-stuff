This is a blog / social media chat app similar to PERN-chat but not a ball of crap because it uses TailwindCSS and Prisma which handles all the backend SQL stuff for me and cuts down on the amount of code needed to write. I was going to add GraphQL but I changed my mind because it just adds extra complexity for no reason.

You can also comment on comments, but you cannot comment on a comment on a comment, because I couldn't figure out how to do the schema for it.

It is not finished yet. The UI is crap and there are console logs. I also still need to add chat and direct messaging, recommended aside section and serverside pagination and search functionality.
